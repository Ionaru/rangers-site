== Introduction ==
More often than not our operations are conducted by a diverse force. While everything is centered around the Infantry Platoon as the core of our force, there can be a variety of support oriented units serving alongside it.

All elements like Aviation, Reconnaissance, Armour or other Support Units are purely around to support and assist the Infantry Platoon. This section is describing the general relationship and responsibilities.
