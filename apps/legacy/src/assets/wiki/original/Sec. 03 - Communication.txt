= General Guidelines =

Communication is an essential factor for teamplay. A certain level of standardization ensures quick and precise communication while limiting misunderstandings. This section features all important Communication related basics. You will find more situation based communication guidelines in the relevant sections.

When it comes to Communication there are several core principles:
* <span style='color:#087b08'>'''Compact'''.</span> Information should be always given with as few words possible. Keeping it short will ensure the ability for others to have their necessary air time to convey their messages.
* <span style='color:#087b08'>'''Clear and Precise'''.</span> Your messages should be clear and precise. Use appropriate known terminology.
* <span style='color:#087b08'>'''Confirmation'''.</span> Always confirm or even read-back orders given. An unconfirmed order should be handle as a non received order, meaning while somebody is failing to confirm, you repeat until confirmation.
*<span style='color:#087b08'> '''Allocatable'''.</span> Always start with alerting the recipients of your message and then state who you are (e.g. "Command this is Alpha" , 'Command' as Recipient and 'Alpha' as Sender)


To ensure good communication you always need to evaluate which information should be broadcasted on which channel. There are multiple channels available, although not all of them are available for each individual.
* Direct Talk (talking normal)
* Squad Radio/Net (main Rifleman Radio)
* Platoon Radio/Net (Leader, 2IC and Special Roles)
* Command Radio/Net (Support Coordination Channel usually Long Range)

Based on the information and the availability of your individual accessible channels you to make a decision what channel to use. There are some basic guidelines when to use Direct Talk and when to use the Radio.


'''Direct Talk:'''
* Shout when using a Grenade (Frag out, Smoke out, Flashing,...)
* Communicate with people in a close proximity, when all recipients can hear you
* Preferably with your buddy team, if radio not absolutely necessary


'''Radio (Squad Net):'''
* Man down!
* Orders
* Spotted Enemies
* Reports
* Buddy Team coordination (from Team to Team or Squad Lead to Team)
* All relevant information where recipients are out Direct Communication range or the importance of this information is so high that it needs to be ensure everyone has to receive it


'''Radio (Platoon/Command Net):'''
* Orders
* Reports and Status Information
* Enemy Movement
* Force Coordination

= Radios =

On default each soldier is carrying a Rifleman Radio AN/PRC-343. Each Squad has their own Squad Net. The Squad Leaders, 2nd in Command, Platoon Leader, Platoon Sergeant and Platoon Medic will also carry an additional Radio connected to the Platoon Net, AN/PRC-152. Furthermore the Platoon Leader will carry a Long-Range Radio to communicate with Support Units such as Aviation on the Command Net, AN/PRC-117F.

It is essential that every soldier is familiar with how to setup and use the Radio. It is mandatory that communication lines remain open at all time, e.g. if a Squad Leader is unconscious, the second in command should go on the Platoon Net and report the situation and assume control of the Squad and the Communication, while the Leader is being treated. In the end every soldier should be ready to take actions to maintain the communication at all time during the mission based on the situation of his unit. It is everyone's duty to ensure a constant uninterrupted line of communication between all elements, no matter the costs. If your unit lacks a Radio capable to connect to the Platoon Net (e.g. AN/PRC-343) may need to one person to switch to the Platoon Actual Net to keep a line of communication.
