== Organisation (Outside of the game) ==
* <span style='color:#087b08'> '''Recruit''' </span> - New member of the 7th Rangers.
* <span style='color:#087b08'> '''Member''' </span> - Basic rank for a member of the 7th Rangers.
* <span style='color:#087b08'> '''NCO''' </span> - Both management and staff involved in managing and administrating the 7th Rangers.
* <span style='color:#087b08'> '''Officer''' </span> - Mangement of the 7th Rangers.

== Platoon ==
The platoon is the entity organising all other elements on the battlefield. It is the center piece of all our deployed units. This makes the platoon leader in charge of the entire operation.

=== Structure ===
* <span style='color:#087b08'> '''Platoon Element''' </span> - Leadership and supportive element of the platoon, generally operating in a second line behind the frontline.
* <span style='color:#087b08'> '''Squad Elements''' </span> - A platoon consists out of up to three squads (Alpha, Bravo & Charlie). Squads are generally the frontline elements and the main element of our platoon.
* <span style='color:#087b08'> '''Support Elements''' </span> - There are various possible support elements such as combat engineers, weapons teams, reconnaissance teams, mechanized or armoured teams. Support elements have generally more freedom and are under less strict control of the platoon leadership. Their main task is to support the squad elements and help them succeed with their tasks. Their freedom enables them to apply their special abilities to their fullest potential.

=== Platoon Element Roles ===
* <span style='color:#087b08'> '''Platoon Leader''' </span> - The Platoon Leader is in charge of the Platoon and the entire operation.
* <span style='color:#087b08'> '''Platoon Sergeant''' </span> - The Platoon Sergeant is the 2nd in command of the Platoon and generally is an engineer.
* <span style='color:#087b08'> '''Platoon Medic''' </span> - The Platoon Medic is in charge of any triage station and generally is responsible to respond to casualties.
* <span style='color:#087b08'> '''Platoon Operators''' </span> - Operators attached to the Platoon to protect and support the Platoon Leader, Sergeant and Medic.

Regulary the Platoon Element splits into two teams. The Platoon Leader and Medic assume a more passive role, while the Sergeant is taking a more aggressive role. In these cases the Platoon Leader and Medic will remain in the second line supporting Squads in need of assistance, while the Sergeant Element, in addition to supporting other squads, may protect the flanks of the Platoon, scout ahead or provide overwatch.
Furthermore the Platoon Leader may delegate leadership responsibilities to the sergeat regarding the execution of general orders. Although the Platoon Leader will always define the objects of the Platoon. The Platoon Sergeant can also act as a runner for the Platoon Leader. It has to be noted that no individual ever operates alone.

=== Command Line of Succession ===
# Platoon Leader
# Platoon Sergeant
# Squad Leaders (Alpha to Charlie) or whoever their successor within the squad / if a squad is combat ineffective another squad leader of a combat effective squad may take command breaking the succession from (Alpha to Charlie) in advantage of keeping momentum.

The mission shall be continued. The death of the Platoon Leader shall not impact the overall objective neither the general decision-making regarding the mission. If the original first in command is part of a reinforcement wave he may take control from his successor. The successor has to hand over command as soon the situation allows and the original commander is in a position to do so, meaning he is back in the vicinity of the active units in the area of operations.

=== Special Weapons ===
Special Weapons e.g. MMG or MAT will be assigned by the Platoon Leader. Generally Medium or Heavy Anti-Tank Weaponry should be assigned to smaller Elements such as a smaller Squad, Support Element or the Platoon Element itself to allow for a more flexible deployment in the field while fullsize Squads remain versatile.

== Squad ==
A squad consists of one Squad Leader, 6 Operators, and one Combat Medic. Usually the squad splits itself into three Fire Teams. Thre Operators each form a Fire Team Blue and Red. The Squad Leader and Combat Medic form the Command Element. Although they might split up and move with one of the Fire Teams each. Squad cohesion is essential to ensure a combat effective and working unit.
